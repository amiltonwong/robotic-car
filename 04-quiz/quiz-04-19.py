# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Implement the function optimum_policy2D() below.
#
# You are given a car in a grid with initial state
# init = [x-position, y-position, orientation]
# where x/y-position is its position in a given
# grid and orientation is 0-3 corresponding to 'up',
# 'left', 'down' or 'right'.
#
# Your task is to compute and return the car's optimal
# path to the position specified in `goal'; where
# the costs for each motion are as defined in `cost'.

# EXAMPLE INPUT:

# grid format:
#     0 = navigable space
#     1 = occupied space 
grid = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]]
goal = [2, 0] # final position
init = [4, 3, 0] # first 2 elements are coordinates, third is direction
cost = [2, 1, 20] # the cost field has 3 values: right turn, no turn, left turn

# EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
# calling optimum_policy2D() should return the array
# 
# [[' ', ' ', ' ', 'R', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', '#'],
#  ['*', '#', '#', '#', '#', 'R'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', ' ', ' ']]
#
# ----------


# there are four motion directions: up/left/down/right
# increasing the index in this array corresponds to
# a left turn. Decreasing is is a right turn.

forward = [[-1,  0], # go up
           [ 0, -1], # go left
           [ 1,  0], # go down
           [ 0,  1]] # do right
forward_name = ['up', 'left', 'down', 'right']

# the cost field has 3 values: right turn, no turn, left turn
action = [-1, 0, 1]
action_name = ['R', '#', 'L']

def optimum_policy2D():
    value = [[[999 for row in range(len(grid[0]))] for col in range(len(grid))],
             [[999 for row in range(len(grid[0]))] for col in range(len(grid))],
             [[999 for row in range(len(grid[0]))] for col in range(len(grid))],
             [[999 for row in range(len(grid[0]))] for col in range(len(grid))]]

    return policy2D # Make sure your function returns the expected grid.


# NOTE: At this point, this is just the skeleton given by Sebastian. I did
#       not actually attempt to code this because it is going to take a fair
#       bit of time. I don't have time for that now, since the homework
#       deadline is looming. I am pretty sure I understand how to do this
#       problem: extend the 2D solution to 3D to account for orientation and
#       the costs of turns that change orientation. Figure out the policy
#       then basically *run* the policy to generate the nice map output
#       he wants. Maybe I'll come back and code this later after the
#       homework deadline just for fun.
