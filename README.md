This is where I keep the code I write for the quizzes and homework problems (after they're graded, of course) for the online [CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373) course offered at udacity.com.

Each folder is prefixed with the corresponding unit number in the course content index. Python files are numbered for the unit and the video number their problems appear in.
